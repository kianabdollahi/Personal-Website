        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Hello</strong>, my name is Kian Abdollahi, a 21 year old student here at BCIT.<br> 
            Born in Ontario, my family quickly decided that our lives would be better off in a small french town near the swiss
            border. My dad being from Iran, did not enjoy Ontario winters, and rightfully so. 
        </p>

        <p>    
            My parents,brother, and I lived there for about 7 years until we decided to move once again, this time to
            <em>Switzerland</em>, and finally when I was 11 back to Canada. I have moved quite a lot in my life, and I
            am incredibly grateful for the experiences that my parents have given me. Even though moving
            was never easy, it has made me a more adaptable and knowledgeable person.
        </p>

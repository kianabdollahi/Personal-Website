            <strong>Hello!</strong>, my name is Kian Abdollahi, a 21 year old
            student here at BCIT. Born in Ontario, my family quickly decided
            that our lives would be better off in a small french town near the
            swiss border. My dad being from Iran, did not enjoy Ontario winters,
            and rightfully so.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph2">
            My parents,brother, and I lived there for about 7 years until we
            decided to move once again, this time to
            <em>Switzerland</em>, and finally when I was 11 back to Canada. I
            have moved quite a lot in my life, and I am incredibly grateful for
            the experiences that my parents have given me. Even though moving
            was never easy, it has made me a more adaptable and knowledgeable
            person.

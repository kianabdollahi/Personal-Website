                    <strong>Hello!</strong>, my name is Kian Abdollahi, a 21 year old student here at BCIT.<br> 
                    Born in Ontario, my family quickly decided that our lives would be better off in a small french town near the swiss
                    border.<br> My dad being from Iran, did not enjoy Ontario winters, and rightfully so. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    My parents,brother, and I lived there for about 7 years until we decided to move once again, this time to
                    <em>Switzerland</em>, and finally when I was 11 back to Canada.<br> I have moved quite a lot in my life, and I
                    am incredibly grateful for the experiences that my parents have given me. Even though moving
                    was never easy, it has made me a more adaptable and knowledgeable person.
